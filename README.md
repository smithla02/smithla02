# Hi there, I'm Luis Smith ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a Data Scientist with a strong background in machine learning engineering, specializing in recommendation systems and pricing models. 

With a blend of technical expertise and business acumen honed at Gojek and J.P. Morgan, I excel at translating complex business needs into technical solutions.

ðŸŒ± I recently completed a **MSc in Computer Science (Machine Learning)** at University of Texas at Austin and I'm looking forward to applying machine learning techniques in future projects.
